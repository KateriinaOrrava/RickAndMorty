          Rick and Morty is the Emmy award-winning half-hour animated hit comedy
          series on Adult Swim that follows a sociopathic genius scientist who
          drags his inherently timid grandson on insanely dangerous adventures
          across the universe. Rick Sanchez is living with his daughter Bethâ€™s

          Summer, and grandson Morty into intergalactic escapades.
